Hepatotoxicity may occur after ingestion of a single dose of more than 7.5 g (adults) or 150 mg/kg (children); a dose of 10 g or more is potentially fatal. Early symptoms (nausea, vomiting, weakness, diaphoresis) usually occur after acute ingestion or overdose large enough to cause hepatic toxicity. A latent period of 24–36 hours exists between ingestion and the onset of symptoms of hepatic injury. Laboratory evidence usually appears within 24–48 hours if severe hepatotoxicity is to occur. Therefore, liver function tests (AST or ALT) should be monitored for up to 48 hours after an acute ingestion. Following the latent period, vomiting, pain in the upper right quadrant and manifestations of hepatic failure including the onset of coma, may ensue. Maximum hepatic necrosis appears 2–5 days following overdose. Signs include gross elevation of ALT, AST, increased bilirubin, hypoglycemia and increased prothrombin time. Acute overdose includes supportive measures, gut decontamination with activated charcoal, and prompt administration of acetylcysteine as an antidote. Laboratory determinations include plasma acetaminophen levels, AST, ALT, prothrombin time, bilirubin, creatinine, urea, blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations.\nProperly timed plasma acetaminophen levels are key, the first level should be drawn at least 4-24 hours post-ingestion as peak concentrations may not be reached before this time and to determine the probability of hepatotoxicity and need for acetylcysteine therapy. Even in the absence of serum level determinations, therapy with acetylcysteine should be promptly instituted if a massive acetaminophen overdose is suspected (i.e., >7.5 g in adults or >150 mg/kg in children) and 24 hours or less have elapsed since ingestion."

Consider discontinuation or dose reduction in patients who develop abnormal LFTs\n• Refeeding syndrome: Refeeding severely undernourished patients with parenteral nutrition may result in the refeeding syndrome (i.e., intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patient becomes anabolic).Carefully monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intakes, while avoiding overfeeding.\n• Anemia: The use of fat emulsion has been associated with anemia likely due to hemodilution.

In local anesthetic toxicity, exogenous lipids provide an alternative source of binding of lipid-soluble local anesthetics, commonly known as the 'lipid sink' effect. This is more relevant to bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine than mepivacaine and prilocaine.

Vasopressin, at therapeutic doses used for vasodilatory shock, stimulates the AVPR1a (or V1) receptor and increases systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure; in response to these effects, a decrease in heart rate and cardiac output may be seen. When the AVPR2 (or V2) receptor is stimulated, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increases which in turn increases water permeability at the renal tubule resulting in decreased urine volume and increased osmolality. Vasopressin, at pressor doses, also causes smooth muscle contraction in the GI tract by stimulating muscular V1 receptors and release of prolactin and ACTH via AVPR1b (or V3) receptors."]
