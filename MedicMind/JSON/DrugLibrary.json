Hepatotoxicity may occur after ingestion of a single dose of more than 7.5 g (adults) or 150 mg/kg (children); a dose of 10 g or more is potentially fatal. Early symptoms (nausea, vomiting, weakness, diaphoresis) usually occur after acute ingestion or overdose large enough to cause hepatic toxicity. A latent period of 24–36 hours exists between ingestion and the onset of symptoms of hepatic injury. Laboratory evidence usually appears within 24–48 hours if severe hepatotoxicity is to occur. Therefore, liver function tests (AST or ALT) should be monitored for up to 48 hours after an acute ingestion. Following the latent period, vomiting, pain in the upper right quadrant and manifestations of hepatic failure including the onset of coma, may ensue. Maximum hepatic necrosis appears 2–5 days following overdose. Signs include gross elevation of ALT, AST, increased bilirubin, hypoglycemia and increased prothrombin time. Acute overdose includes supportive measures, gut decontamination with activated charcoal, and prompt administration of acetylcysteine as an antidote. Laboratory determinations include plasma acetaminophen levels, AST, ALT, prothrombin time, bilirubin, creatinine, urea, blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations.\nProperly timed plasma acetaminophen levels are key, the first level should be drawn at least 4-24 hours post-ingestion as peak concentrations may not be reached before this time and to determine the probability of hepatotoxicity and need for acetylcysteine therapy. Even in the absence of serum level determinations, therapy with acetylcysteine should be promptly instituted if a massive acetaminophen overdose is suspected (i.e., >7.5 g in adults or >150 mg/kg in children) and 24 hours or less have elapsed since ingestion."
