##General Structure of a Medical Directive

All Medical Directives follow the same format and are comprised of the following sections:
**Indication:** The general medical complaint or problem to which the medical directive applies.
**Contraindications:** Clinical parameters that if present, preclude the performance of a procedure or the administration of a drug.**Treatment:** Description of the type of procedure to be performed or the dosing of a drug.
**Clinical Considerations:** Key clinical points that provide general guidance to the proper performance of a procedure or the administration of a medication.
**Patch Point:** A treatment option that requires prior authorization by the Transport Medicine Physician (TMP).<table style="width:100%">

</table>**Scope of Practice**The Medical Directives have been formulated to incorporate most of Ornge’s 4 scopes of practice within each one therefore the Paramedic is responsible to practice within their authorized category at all times. Additional (“Auxiliary”) skills may be delegated through use of the Auxiliary Medical Directives. Delegation of Auxiliary Medical Directives by the Medical Director to Paramedics is optional and may be introduced after consultation and mutual agreement between the MAC and the Service Operator that employs the Paramedic.
**Patch Information:**Crews are encouraged to patch at any time. When possible, a two/three way patch while enroute to the patient should be done in order to minimize in hospital times with a stable patient or to help facilitate the transport of time sensitive patients.
Patch Format: All patches should be presented using the SBARR format outlined below
