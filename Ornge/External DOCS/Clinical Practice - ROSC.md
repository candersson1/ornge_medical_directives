* Rapid evaluation of a 12 lead ECG following return of spontaneous circulation in victims of cardiac arrest to evaluate timing of emergent invasive cardiac procedures^1* Transport to a centre capable of performing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for patients who have suffered an out of hospital cardiac arrest^2* In patients with hypotension, a combination of crystalloid and vasopressors/inotropic support may berequired to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion balanced with avoidance of worsening myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of ischemia/infarction. Target MAP should exceed 65 mmHg^(3, 4, 5)* Core body temperature should be monitored^6 as hyperthermia in the post cardiac arrest setting is associated with increased mortality and should be avoided^7* The use of hypothermia or targeted temperature management to maintain core body temperature between 32-36 degrees Celsius is associated with improved neurologic outcome^(8, 9) and should bemaintained during inter-facility transport. The initiation of cooling is not essential pre-hospital during the cardiac arrest resuscitation or immediately post return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)^(10)* Adequate sedation and the use of neuromuscular blockade should be considered for patient comfort and to suppress shivering facilitating reaching target temperature^(11, 12)* Hypoxemia as well as hyperoxemia must be avoided as they are associated with lower survival rates. Oxygen administration should be titrated to maintain oxygen saturation values between 94% and 98% or aPaO2 of approximately 100 mmHg^(13, 14)* Hypocarbia as well as hypercarbia must be avoided. Ventilation should be based upon arterial blood gas measurement. Hyperventilation alone should not be used to compensate for metabolic acidosis as thelactic acidosis is ideally best managed with restoration of adequate perfusion. Ideal target PaCO2 should be maintained at approximate physiologic parameters between 40-45mmHg, target EtC02 should bemaintained between 35-40 mmHg^(15, 16) however, further adjustments can be made by the TMP
