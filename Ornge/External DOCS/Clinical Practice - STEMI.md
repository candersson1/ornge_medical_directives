Class IIa<ol type="a"><li>Reperfusion therapy is reasonable for patients with STEMI and symptom onset between 12 to 24 hourswho have clinical and/or ECG evidence of ongoing ischemia. Primary PCI is the preferred strategy in thispopulation (2013 ACCF/AHA 16, 19, 30) <sup>1, 2, 5, 13</sup></li></ol><b>Transfer to a PCI-Capable Hospital after Fibrinolytic Therapy</b>  Class I<ol type ="a"><li>Immediate transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for coronary angiography is recommended for suitable patients with STEMI who develop cardio-genic shock or acute severe HF, irrespective of the time delay from MI onset (2013 ACCF/AHA 128)<sup>1, 14</sup></li></ol> 
Class II<ol type="a"><li>Urgent transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for coronary angiography is reasonable for patients with STEMI who demonstrate evidence of failed reperfusion or reocclusion after fibrinolytic therapy (2013 ACCF/AHA 129-132) <sup>1, 15-18</sup></li><li>Transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for coronary angiography is reasonable for patients with STEMI who have received fibrinolytic therapy even when hemodynamically stable and with clinical evidence ofsuccessful reperfusion. Angiography can be performed as soon as logistically feasible at the receiving hospital, and ideally within 24 hours, but should not be performed within the first 2 to 3 hours afteradministration of fibrinolytic therapy (2013 ACCF/AHA 133-138) <sup>1, 19-24</sup></li></ol><b>Standard Medical Therapies with PCI</b>  <ol><li>Oxygen</li>Class I<ol type="a"><li>Supplemental oxygen should be administered to patients with STEMI with arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%, respiratory distress, or other high-risk features of hypoxemia<sup>53</sup>.

Intravenous nitroglycerin maybe useful to treat patients with STEMI and hypertension or Heart Failure. Nitrates should not be given topatients with hypotension, marked bradycardia or tachycardia, RV infarction, or phosphodiesteraseinhibitor use within the previous 24 to 48 hours (2013 ACCF/AHA 444) <sup>1, 51</sup></li>
