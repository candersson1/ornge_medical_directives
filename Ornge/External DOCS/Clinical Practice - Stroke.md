<b>Ischemic Stroke</b>  Acute blood pressure management<ol type="a"><li>The ideal level of blood pressure to target in the hyperacute phase is unknown at this time</li><li>Ischemic stroke patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy: reduce blood pressure to a target of below 180/105mmHg)</li><li>Ischemic stroke patients not eligible for thrombolytic therapy: Treatment of hypertension in the setting of acute ischemic stroke should not be routinely undertaken</li><li>Extreme blood pressure elevation (i.e. systolic greater than 220 or diastolic greater than 120mmHg) should be treated to reduce the blood pressure by approximately 15%, and not more than 25%, overthe first 24h, with further gradual reduction thereafter to targets for long-term secondary stroke prevention</li></ol>Blood glucose abnormalities  <ol type="a"><li>All patients with suspected acute stroke should have their blood glucose concentration checked</li><li>Hypoglycemia should be corrected immediately</li></ol>
Additional management  <ol type="a"><li>Supplemental oxygen should be provided for patients with oxygen saturation below 94%. Supplemental oxygen is not required for patients with normal oxygen saturation levels (94% or above)</li><li>Temperature should be routinely monitored and treated if above 37.5°C</li></ol>
<b>Acute Ischemic Stroke Therapy (Acute ischemic stroke therapy best practice recommendations 2015)</b>  Patient selection  <ol type="a"><li>Symptoms of disabling stroke - intravenous tPA (within 4.5h from stroke symptom onset) and interventional treatment with endovascular therapy (within a six-hour window from stroke symptom onset)</li></ol>  
Intravenous thrombolysis<ol type="a"><li>Administration of tPA 0.9mg/kg to a maximum of 90mg total dose, with 10% (0·09mg/kg) given as an intravenous bolus over one-minute and the remaining 90% (0·81mg/kg) given as an intravenousinfusion over 60 minutes</li><li>Management of complications from tPA administration:</li><ol type="i"><li>There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, or platelet transfusions for tPA-associated bleeding</li></ol></ol>
Endovascular therapy<ol type="a"><li>Endovascular therapy is indicated in patients who have received intravenous tPA and those who are noteligible for intravenous tPA, or those select patients within 6-12 hours of presentation. Patients eligiblefor intravenous tPA as well as endovascular therapy should also be treated with intravenous tPA, whichcan be initiated while simultaneously preparing the angiography suite for endovascular therapy</li></ol>
Acute Aspirin Therapy (Acute aspirin therapy best practice recommendations 2015)<ol type="a"><li>All acute stroke patients not already on an antiplatelet agent and not receiving tPA therapy should begiven at least 160mg of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) immediately as a one-time loading dose after brainimaging has excluded intracranial hemorrhage and after dysphagia screening has been performed andpassed</li><li>In patients treated with tPA, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) should be delayed until after the 24-hour postthrombolysisscan has excluded intracranial hemorrhage</li><li>In dysphagic patients, ASA may be given by enteral tube (80mg daily) or by rectal suppository (325mgdaily)</li><li>In pediatric patients, initial treatment with anticoagulation (heparin) or aspirin at established pediatricdosing should be considered and continued until cervical artery dissection and intracardiac thrombus isexcluded. If neither is present, switch to acute aspirin therapy at dose of 1–5mg/kg<sup>1</sup></li><li>In patients already on ASA prior to ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, clopidogrel may beconsidered as an alternative. If rapid action is required, then a loading dose of 300mg of clopidogrelcould be considered, followed by a maintenance dose of 75mg once a day</li></ol>
<b>Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage (Acute ICH best practice recommendations 2015)</b>  Blood pressure management  <ol type="a"><li>There is presently insufficient evidence to demonstrate that lower blood pressure targets areassociated with better clinical outcomes, and research is ongoing in this area. American heartAssociation guidelines suggest that for patients presenting with SBP 150-220 mmHg that loweringblood pressure to a target SBP of 140 mmHg is safe.</li><li>Labetalol is recommended as a first-line treatment for acute blood pressure management if there areno contraindications</li></ol>
Blood glucose abnormalities:  <ol type="a"><li>All patients with suspected acute stroke should have their blood glucose concentration checked</li><li>Hypoglycemia should be corrected immediately</li></ol>
Additional management  <ol type="a"><li>Supplemental oxygen should be provided for patients with oxygen saturation below 94%.Supplemental oxygen is not required for patients with normal oxygen saturation levels (94% or above)</li><li>Temperature should be routinely monitored and treated if above 37.5°C</li></ol>
Management of anticoagulation  <ol type="a"><li>Patients on warfarin - PCC is preferred because the onset of action is fast, but fresh-frozen plasma andvitamin K could be used as alternative if PCC is not available</li><li>Antiplatelet agents (i.e. ASA, clopidogrel, dipyridamole/ASA) should be stopped immediately in patientswho are routinely on these agents</li><li>Anticoagulation Reversal NOAC</li><ol type="i"><li>Dabigatran only: Idarucizumab</li><ul><li>5 grams (2 x 2.5 vials) in 100 mL over 10 minutes by bolus infusion</li><li>Compatible with NS</li><li>Risk: anaphylaxis</li></ul><li>Rivaroxaban/apixaban</li><ul><li>aPCC/PCC-recommended by expert opinion and in vitro/rats<sup>2, 3, 4</sup></li><li>PCC 2000 IU flat dose (no evidence to support one dose over another)</li><li>Repeat at 1 hour if ongoing bleeding</li><li>Unknown if you can use the INR to determine if there is unbound drug left after reversal</li><li>Antidotes in development</li>
