##Ornge Clinical Practice Guideline: Mechanical Ventilation<i>Please refer to the Drug Monographs and References document for references listed in the CPGs</i>  
<ol><li> Mechanical ventilation is usually indicated in the following scenarios:</li>	<ol type="a"><li> Hypoxemic respiratory failure</li>	<li>Hypercapneic respiratory failure</li>	<li>Mixed hypoxemic/hypercapneic respiratory failure</li>	<li>Transport of patient intubated for other reasons; i.e. ( airway 	protection for primary neurological issues, excessive secretions, shock)</li></ol><li>Mechanical ventilation may be harmful to patients, especially those with acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS), through one or more of the following mechanisms:</li>	<ol type="a"><li>Volutrauma (excessive tidal volumes- ideal target 6 mL/kg ideal body weight to avoid alveolar overdistension)</li>	<li>Barotrauma (excessive plateau airway pressures- ideal target < 30 cm H20)</li>	<li>Atelectrauma (recurrent opening and closing of alveoli- ideal target of maintaining an “open” lungusing PEEP)</li>	<li>Biotrauma (release of local and systemic inflammatory cytokines/mediators from lungs due tovolutrauma, barotrauma and atelectrauma)</li></ol><li>Appropriate endotracheal tube placement must be confirmed prior to departing the sending facility:	<ol type="a"><li>If available, a Chest X-ray (CXR) should be reviewed by the Ornge team at the sending facility to confirmappropriate endotracheal tube depth of insertion. Alternatively confirmation of appropriate ETTposition can be obtained through discussion with the sending physician or review of a final report froma radiologist</li>	<li>Should the clinical situation warrant in the judgment of the Ornge crew and the TMP on duty, clinicalconfirmation of ETT position without radiological confirmation may be sufficient when delays intransport to definitive care place the patient at greater risk than the potential risk of transportingwithout review of the CXR	<li>Continuous ETCO2 monitoring should be performed to assist in detection of inadvertent ETTdislodgement during transport</li>	<li>ETT must be properly secured during packaging for transport. In cases of anticipated potential difficultyin reintubation after potential ETT dislodgement, ongoing neuromuscular blockade in addition toheavy sedation should be considered</li></ol><li>ETT cuff inflation pressures should be checked and documented for all intubated patients to avoid excessivecuff pressures, which can lead to tracheal ischemia and injury<li>Clamping of the ETT prior to any intentional disconnection from the ventilator; i.e. when transferring thepatient from a hospital ventilator at the sending facility to the transport ventilator should be performed toavoid lung de-recruitment, ensuring analgosedation +/- paralysis is maximized to prevent negative consequencessuch as pulmonary edema caused by maximal inspiration attempts against a clamped ETT.  **NOTE:** Do not clamp an armour ETT as this may result in a kink in the metal reinforcement of these ETTs.</li><li>An appropriate mode of ventilation should be selected based on the patient condition</li><ol type="a"><li>Patients with spontaneous respiratory effort not requiring high levels of mechanical ventilationsupport should be ventilated using pressure support ventilation, which has been shown to decreasesedation requirements and provide better patient comfort. PSV levels should not be set < 8 cm H2O</li><li>Patients requiring higher levels of mechanical ventilation support due to severe respiratory failure,patients without adequate drive to breathe and patients who require control of ETCO2 for nonrespiratoryreasons should be ventilated using a controlled mode of ventilation (AC with pressurecontrol, or volume control)</li><li>Ornge crew should be prepared to switch from pressure support to a controlled mode of ventilation inthe event of over sedation or other change in clinical condition</li></ol><li>Goal-directed ventilation should be provided by the Ornge crew using medical directives or direct medical controlthrough patch as follows:</li>	<ol type="a"><li>Initial inspired oxygen concentration should be determined by matching sending hospital settings orstarting at 100% oxygen and titrating down based on oxygen saturation readings</li>
