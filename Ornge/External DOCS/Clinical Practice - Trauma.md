Organized systems of trauma care improve mortality for trauma patients<sup>1</sup>  Air Transport from scene should be considered for trauma patients meeting appropriate physiologic and anatomiccriteria for serious injury to an appropriate trauma centre if there will be a significant time savings^2  Utilization of backboards for spinal immobilization during transport should be judicious, so that the potentialbenefits outweigh the risks. Patients suffering penetrating mechanism of injury (gunshot or stab wound), without asignificant blunt trauma mechanism and without neurological symptoms may be transported without spinalprecautions. In appropriate cases, spinal precautions can be maintained by application of a rigid cervical collar andsecuring the patient firmly to the EMS stretcher and may be most appropriate for patients who must betransported for a protracted time, particularly prior to interfacility transfer^3  Hypotensive trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock^4 should be treated using a damage control resuscitativeapproach:
* Hypothermia should be prevented, and treated aggressively* Hemorrhage control should be secured using tourniquets for extremity injury* Blood component therapy should be considered early, in a 1:1:1 ratio, if possible* Crystalloids should be minimized, if blood products are available* Permissive hypotension should be considered for patients suffering penetrating torso injury* Systolic blood pressure should be 90 mmHg. However, in all cases, perfusion of the brain (level of consciousness) must be maintained
Tranexamic acid (1 g over 10 minutes followed by second 1g in 1 hour) should be administered to trauma patientswho are believed to be bleeding, and who are tachycardic or hypotensive (HR > 100, or Systolic BP < 100). Thisshould only be initiated if patient seen within 3 hours of the injury^5In the setting of severe traumatic brain injury (GCS <9), hypoxemia (SpO2 <90%) and hypotension (systolic BP <90mmHg) are associated with increased mortality and should be avoided<sup>13,11</sup>. A MAP ≥80 mmHg should bemaintained.
Scene intubation for patients with traumatic brain injury is controversial^14. It may be reasonable to manage withBLS interventions if they are successful at maintaining a patent airway with appropriate oxygenation andventilation when transport times to the Lead Trauma Hospital (LTH) are relatively short (<30 min)<sup>6,15-17</sup>General measures for prevention and treatment of elevated ICP should include elevation of the head of bed to 30degrees, optimization of venous drainage by keeping the neck in neutral position, using appropriately sized cervicalcollar, loosening neck braces if too tight, and appropriate management of analgesia, sedation and nausea^18Target PaCO2 should be maintained at 35-40 mm Hg (surrogate marker of ETCO2 should be maintained at 33-38mmHg) and hyperventilation (ETCO2 < 33 mmHg) should be avoided unless the patient shows signs of cerebralherniation. Signs of cerebral herniation include dilated and unreactive pupils, asymmetric pupils, a motor examthat identifies extensor posturing or no response, or progressive neurologic deterioration (decrease in GCS of >2points from patient’s best score of < 9)<sup>7,13,21</sup>
Hyperosmolar agents (hypertonic saline, mannitol) may be considered for patients showing signs of cerebralherniation and may improve cerebral blood flow<sup>8,9,10,19,20</sup>. Mannitol should NOT be used in patients withsuspected hypovolemia (tachycardia and/or hypotension).Hyperventilation can be considered as a second line therapy if there are severe signs of increased ICP (includingCushing’s triad with systolic hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations) or signs of cerebral herniationdespite the first line therapies listed above. Hyperventilation should target PaCO2 32-35 (surrogate marker ofETCO2 30-35).
Hyperoxia (defined by a supranormal arterial O<sub>2</sub> tension) may be associated with increased mortality in traumaticbrain injury and should be avoided maintaining Sa02 94-98%^12
