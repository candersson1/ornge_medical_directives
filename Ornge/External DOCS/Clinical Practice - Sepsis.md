<ol><li>Actively look for symptoms and signs of sepsis in all patients transported by Ornge. Case definitions of sepsisinclude suspected or documented infection along with SOFA score > 2</li><li>All patients with sepsis should be risk stratified by determining whether they meet criteria for septic shocksepsiswith persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP >65 mmHg and having a serum lactatelevel >2 mmol/L despite adequate volume resuscitation</li><li>All patients with sepsis should be evaluated for compliance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines bundles:</li><ol type="a"><li>Measure lactate level</li><ol type="i"><li>OCC CO should document the most recent lactate level during call taking for all patients identifiedwith sepsis</li><li>If a lactate level is not available, the serum bicarbonate and anion gap can be documented as a surrogateto rule out most cases of elevated lactate (normal HCO3 and normal anion gap make significantlactic acidosis unlikely)</li><li>OCC CO and/or the TMP should request the sending to obtain a lactate level if possible prior toparamedic arrival taking into account resources at the sending facility and avoiding any delays intransport</li><li>If a point-of-care laboratory device is available to the Ornge crew, a lactate level should be measuredand documented upon patient contact if no recent lactate level is available from the sendingfacility</li><li>ETCO2 level may be measured and documented in the absence of an available lactate level as analternate method of determining acid/base status (lower ETCO2 usually correlates with lowerserum bicarbonate levels as a form of compensation unless the patient’s respiratory drive is suppressed)</li></ol><li>Obtain blood cultures prior to administration of antibiotics</li><ol type="i"><li>Yield of blood cultures is reduced if antibiotics are given prior to obtaining cultures, which complicatesantimicrobial stewardship efforts and may add to patient risk if resistance patterns are notidentified</li><li>OCC CO and/or TMP should determine whether blood cultures have been obtained at the sendingfacility, and if not, encourage the sending facility to obtain and process the samples</li><li>In the event that a sending facility cannot process blood cultures but can obtain samples, the OCCCO and/or TMP should determine whether inoculated blood culture bottles can be transported forfurther processing at the receiving facility to facilitate and effect culture sampling and avoid delaysin antibiotic administration.</li></ol><li>Administer broad spectrum antibiotics</li><ol type="i"><li>Delays in antibiotic therapy are associated with increased risk of mortality for patients with sepsis</li><li>Administration of antibiotics that do not treat the ultimately identified organism(s) is associatedwith increased risk of mortality for patients with sepsis</li><li>Through early contact with the sending facility, the OCC CO and the TMP should collaborativelydetermine the most likely source of infection and determine whether appropriate antibiotics havebeen administered</li><li>Ornge crews should review the medical history, including any potential culture or imaging resultsthat would assist the TMP in confirming appropriate antibiotic therapy has been provided</li><li>The TMP and the Ornge crew should review the case during patch and, if appropriate antibioticshave not been given, should order those to be administered during transport when feasible</li></ol><li>Administer at least 30 mL/kg of crystalloid for hypotension and/or lactate > 4 mmol/L</li><ol type="i"><li>Hypotension is defined as a systolic BP < 90 mm Hg/MAP < 65 mm Hg or a drop in more than 40 mgHg from baseline (important to note for patients with baseline hypertension, as a systolic BP of >90 mm Hg may represent significant hypotension associated with hypoperfusion)</li><li>All patients with hypotension or lactate > 4 mmol/L should receive at least 30 mL/kg of crystalloid</li><li>Isotonic crystalloid is the fluid of choice for treatment of hypotension associated with septic shockto improve preload associated with venodilatation and capillary leak</li><li>0.9% Normal Saline or Ringer’s Lactate are the usual bolus fluids to be used for resuscitation fromseptic shock</li><li>Large volumes of Normal Saline may induce a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (pH 5.5), thereforeconsideration for use of Ringer’s Lactate (pH 6.5) is reasonable when large volume (> 30mL/kg)</li>crystalloid resuscitation is anticipated<li>Large bore peripheral IV access should be used if possible to rapidly deliver fluid boluses in septicshock</li><li>Reliance on infusion pumps with infusion rates limited to 1200 mL/h should be avoided due to thesuboptimal rate of fluid resuscitation</li><li>Pressure bags can be considered to assist in the rapid infusion of fluids during resuscitation fromseptic shock; a manual blood pressure cuff can be substituted when pressure bags are not available</li><li>Consider insertion of an intraosseous needle to facilitate fluid resuscitation when adequate largebore peripheral IV access cannot be achieved</li><li>Artificial colloids do not improve outcomes compared with crystalloid resuscitation in patients withseptic shock, and may be associated with increased risk of renal dysfunction and coagulopathy</li><li>Artificial colloids (i.e., Pentaspan, Voluven) should not be administered to patients in septic shock</li><li>There is no convincing evidence for clinical benefit from routine use of albumin as resuscitationfluid compared with crystalloid in patients with septic shock, therefore albumin (5% or 25%) shouldnot be used as the primary resuscitation fluid in septic shock and reserved for use only in isolatedcases with specific indications (i.e., severe hypoalbuminemia)</li></ol><li>Add vasopressors for refractory hypotension despite at least 30 mL/kg of crystalloid targeting MAP > 65mm Hg</li><ol type="i"><li>Vasopressor can be used prior to completion of bolus in cases of profound shock or hypoperfusion</li><li>Norepinephrine is the vasopressor of choice for managing refractory hypotension in septic shock</li><li>EPINEPHrine infusion may be used as an additional vasopressor for cases of refractory hypotensiondespite high doses of norepinephrine or when poor cardiac contractility (LV or RV) is clinically suspected(CCP crew only)</li><li>Vasopressin infusion may be used as an additional vasopressor for cases of refractory hypotensiondespite high doses of norepinephrine in the absence of clinically suspected poor contractility (CCPcrew only)</li><li>DOPamine should be reserved for septic shock patients with bradycardia and/or as a second vasopressoragent in patients with hypotension refractory to high dose norepinephrine being transportedby an ACP(f) crew</li><li>Patients on high rates of norepinephrine infusion at the sending facility should generally be transportedby a CCP crew to allow additional flexibility for additional vasopressor agents not availableto an ≥ACP(f) When a CCP crew is assigned to transport a patient with septic shock requiring vasopressorsupport, the TMP should consider encouraging placement of an arterial line by the sendingfacility prior to Ornge crew arrival when the sending facility has staff trained and available for arterialline insertion</li><li>When a patient is requiring ongoing vasopressor support, the TMP should consider requestingplacement of a central venous catheter by the sending facility prior to Ornge crew arrival when thesending facility has staff trained and available for central line insertion</li><li>When a patient is requiring ongoing vasopressor support with poor peripheral IV access and nopossibility of timely central venous line insertion, the TMP should consider recommending placementof an intraosseous needle by the sending facility or the Ornge crew</li><li>Failure to improve blood pressure with increasing doses of vasopressors should prompt considerationof adjunctive treatments such as:</li>
* Additional fluid resuscitation* Calcium supplementation to improve vasomotor tone (suspected or confirmed with correctedCa < 2.2 or ionized Ca < 1.0)* Corticosteroids (suspected adrenal insufficiency, history of chronic use of steroids, hypotensionrefractory to fluids and vasopressors)* Transfusion for untreated anemia (Hb < 70 g/L = need for transfusion to increase oxygen delivery)* Addition of an inotrope to improve cardiac contractility, such as DOBUTamine or an additionalpressor with inotropic properties (i.e., EPINEPHrine or DOPamine)* Treatment of other causes of shock (i.e., primary cardiogenic, hemorrhage, obstructive shocksuch as pericardial tamponade/massive pulmonary embolism/tension pneumothorax)</ol><li>In the event of persistent hypotension after initial fluid administration (MAP < 65 mm Hg) or if initiallactate was ≥4 mmol/L, re-assess volume status and tissue perfusion and document findings accordingto the following recommendations:</li><ol type="i"><li>DOCUMENT REASSESSMENT OF VOLUME STATUS AND TISSUE PERFUSION WITH:</li><ul><li>Repeat focused exam (after initial fluid resuscitation) including vital signs, cardiopulmonary status,capillary refill, pulse, and skin findings (i.e., mottling)</li></ul></ol><li>Re-measure lactate if initial lactate elevated</li><ol type="i"><li>Reassess lactate in 1-2 hour intervals (not relevant for short transport times, should be repeated ifit has been at least 2 hours since last level if possible)</li><li> > 10% reduction in lactate level from baseline is reassuring</li><li>Lactate level that is increasing or failing to decrease should prompt assessment for causes of refractoryshock</li><ul><li>Untreated anemia (Hb < 70 g/L = need for transfusion to increase oxygen delivery)</li><li>Impaired cardiac contractility, consider addition of inotrope such as DOBUTamine or other pressorwith inotropic effect (i.e., EPINEPHrine or DOPamine)</li><li>Other causes of shock (i.e., primary cardiogenic, hypovolemia/hemorrhage, obstructive shocksuch as pericardial tamponade/massive pulmonary embolism/tension pneumothorax)</li>
