Consider and Document Risk Factors for Severe Asthma to risk stratify patients experiencing asthmaexacerbations. Features include:
* Increased usage of puffers* Steroids* Prior intubations* Previous ICU admissions* Tiring* Silent chest* Poor pulmonary function test results or concerning blood gas results (increased or normal PCO₂)^1
Oxygenation should be monitored and supplemental oxygen should be used to support adequate oxygenation inhypoxic asthma patients.^2 All patients should receive aggressive B2 agonists, MDI when possible and nebulizedwhen the patient is unable.^3 IV B2 agonists may be considered for refractory severe asthma.^4 All patients shouldreceive anticholinergics by MDI (metered dose inhaler) or nebulized for severe asthma.^5 Mg sulphate should beconsidered and routinely used for severe asthma.^6 Inhaled steroids should be used for severe asthma.^7 Systemicsteroids should be used PO or IV for all cases of severe asthma.^8 For refractory severe asthma, EPINEPHrine IM orIV can be used.^4 Non Invasive PPV should be used when tolerated by the patient with the aim to avoid intubation.^9Intubation should be used when severe asthma is refractory to other interventions.^10 The decision to intubateshould be based mainly on clinical judgement. Clinical judgment is crucial because many patients presenting withhypercapnia do not require intubation and thus the decision should not be based solely on blood gases.^11Markers of deterioration include:  * Rising carbon dioxide levels (including normalization in a previously hypocapnic patient)* Exhaustion* Mental status depression* Hemodynamic instability and refractory hypoxaemia
Ventilation strategies should include:* Prolongation of the I:E ratio (extending E time and shortening I time)* Using adequate analgesia, sedation and paralysis. Ketamine is the preferred agent.* Tidal volumes of 5-6 ml/kg Ideal Body Weight* RR 8-12 breaths/min* PEEP 5 cm H₂O* pH above 7.25* Pplat <30 if possible.^12 (see Ventilation medical directive)* Ventilation strategies should focus on minimizing gas-trapping.^13 

Dynamic hyperinflation with increased intrathoracic pressure and hypotension may occur particularly withintubated asthmatic patients that are over-ventilated. Compress the chest and allow for exhalation of Auto-PEEP inthe case of hypotension, shock and PEA in the setting of an intubated/apneic asthmatic. Pneumothoraces shouldalso be considered.
