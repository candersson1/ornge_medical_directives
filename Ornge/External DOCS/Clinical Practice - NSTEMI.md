####Early Hospital Care: Recommendations<b>Standard Medical Therapies</b>
<ol><li>Oxygen</li>  Class I  
	<ol type="a"><li>Supplemental oxygen should be administered to patients with NSTEMI with arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%, respiratory distress, or other high-risk features of hypoxemia <sup>37</sup>. Oxygen should be titrated to SpO2 94-98%</li></ol><li>Nitrates</li>  Class I  	<ol type="a"><li> Patients with NSTEMI with continuing ischemic pain should receive <b>sublingual nitroglycerin</b> (0.3 mgâ€“ 0.4 mg) every 5 minutes for up to 3 doses, after which an assessment should be made about the need for intravenous nitroglycerin if not contraindicated</li>	<li> <b>Intravenous nitroglycerin</b> is indicated for patients with NSTEMI for the treatment of persistent ischemia, heart failure (HF), or hypertension (2014 AHA/ACC 106-111)<sup>1-7</sup> </li></ol>
	Class III: Harm<ol type="a" start="3"><li> Nitrates should not be administered to patients with NSTEMI who recently received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, especially within 24 hours of sildenafil or vardenafil, or within 48 hours of tadalafil (2014 AHA/ACC 112-114) <sup>1(19), 8-10</sup></li></ol><li>Analgesic Therapy</li>  Class IIb  	<ol type="a"><li>In the absence of contraindications, it may be reasonable to administer <b>Morphine Sulfate or fentaNYL</b> intravenously to patients with NSTEMI if there is continued ischemic chest pain despite treatment with maximally tolerated anti-ischemic medications (2014 AHA/ACC 115-116) <sup>1, 11, 12</sup></li></ol></ol>

<b>Initial Antiplatelet/Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Definite or Likely NSTEMI</b>
<ol><li>Initial Oral and Intravenous Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Definite or Likely NSTEMI</li>Class I	<ol type="a"><li><b>Non-enteric-coated, chewable aspirin (160 mg to 325 mg)</b> should be given to all patients with NSTEMIwithout contraindications as soon as possible after presentation, and a maintenance dose of aspirin(81 mg/day to 160 mg/day) should be continued indefinitely (2014 AHA/ACC 142-144) <sup>1, 13, 14, 15</sup> </li><li>In patients with NSTEMI who are unable to take aspirin because of hypersensitivity or major gastrointestinal intolerance, a loading dose of <b>clopidogrel</b> followed by a daily maintenance dose should be administered (2014 AHA/ACC 145)<sup>1(22), 16</sup> </li><li>A P2Y12 inhibitor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor) in addition to aspirin should be given to all patients with NSTEMI without contraindications, and administered for up to 12 months to all patients with NSTEMI without contraindications who are treated with either an early invasive or ischemia-guided strategy. Options include:</li><ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li><b>Clopidogrel:</b> 300 mg or 600 mg loading dose, then 75 mg daily</li><ul style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>600 mg usually intended for patients who will undergo angioplasty</li></ul><li><b>Ticagrelor:</b> 180 mg loading dose, then 90 mg twice daily</li></ul></ol><li>Initial Parenteral Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients with Definite NSTE-ACS</li>Class I  <ol type="a"><li>In patients with NSTEMI, anticoagulation, in addition to antiplatelet therapy, is recommended for all patients irrespective of initial treatment strategy. Treatment options include:</li><ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li><b>Enoxaparin:</b> 1 mg/kg subcutaneous (SubQ) every 12 hours (reduce dose to 1 mg/kg SubQ oncedaily in patients with creatinine clearance [CrCl] <30 mL/min) until percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is performed. An initial intravenous loading dose is 30 mg (2014 AHA/ACC 151-153)<sup>1, 17-19</sup></li><li><b>Unfractionated heparin (UFH) IV:</b> initial loading dose of 60 IU/kg (MAX 4,000 IU) with initial infusion of 12 IU/kg per hour (MAX 1,000 IU/h) adjusted per activated partial thromboplastin timeto maintain therapeutic anticoagulation according to the specific hospital protocol until PCI is performed (2014 AHA/ACC 160-166)<sup>1, 20-26</sup><li><b>Bivalirudin:</b> 0.10 mg/kg loading dose followed by 0.25 mg/kg per hour (only in patients managed with an early invasive strategy), continued until diagnostic angiography or PCI, with only provisionaluse of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, provided the patient is also treated with DAPT (2014 AHA/ACC 146,147,154,155)<sup>1, 27-30</sup></li><li><b>Fondaparinux:</b> 2.5 mg SC daily, continued for the duration of hospitalization or until PCI is performed (2014 AHA/ACC 156-158) <sup>1, 31-33</sup>. If PCI is performed while the patient is onfondaparinux, an additional anticoagulant with anti-IIa activity (either UFH or bivalirudin) should be administered because of the risk of catheter thrombosis (2014 AHA/ACC 157-159) <sup>1, 32-34</sup></li></ul></ol>Class III: Harm  <ol type="a"><li>In patients with NSTEMI (i.e., without ST elevation, true posterior MI, or left bundle-branch block not known to be old), intravenous fibrinolytic therapy should not be used (2014 AHA/ACC 167,168) <sup>1, 35, 36</sup>
