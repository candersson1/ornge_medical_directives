##Ornge Clinical Practice Guideline: Sedation and Pain Management for Intubated and Ventilated PatientsCCPs may administer sedation and analgesia without patching, within the dosage and MAP parameters outlinedbelow. Caution must be taken to avoid sedation/analgesia related hypotension by titrating dosage slowly and toeffect utilizing the sedation/analgesia scales below. **ALL intubated patients receiving sedation/analgesia shouldhave a sedation and analgesia score calculated, monitored and documented throughout transport.** Titrate toOrnge Sedation Score -4, to Pain Score 0-2. All patients should receive both analgesia and sedation (Ketamine canbe utilized alone if required as it provides both analgesia and sedation). If MAPs drop below the lower boundarythen, sedation/analgesia should be reduced or discontinued and action taken to correct the low MAP.
Some clinical conditions require higher MAP parameters to maintain perfusion - utilize a MAP of > 80 as a lower BPparameter for patients with possible increased ICP (TBI, ICH), ischemic CVA, or spinal cord injury.
