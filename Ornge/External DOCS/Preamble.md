##Preamble

This updated version of the Ornge Medical Directives (MD) has been reviewed and modified by the Medical Advisory Committee (MAC), Ornge Base Hospital (BH) personnel and the Paramedics on the Professional Practice Advisory Committee (PPAC).
pcp
It is the responsibility of each Primary Care Flight Paramedic/PCP(f), Advanced Care Land Paramedic/ACP(L), Advanced Care Flight Paramedic/ACP(f), Critical Care Paramedic/CCP to identify the skill sets that he/she is not as yet certified to perform or their full or provisional status to the Transport Medicine Physician or Transport Medicine Paediatrician (TMP) during contact.

The Adult TMPs will be responsible for clinical care of all patients eighteen years of age and older (≥ 18 years) while the Transport Medicine Paediatricians will be responsible for patients UNDER eighteen years of age (< 18 years).

The Adult TMP acts as a backup in the event that the Transport Medicine Paediatrician on call is not available. There is also an adult TMP on backup call should the primary on call TMPs not be available.

**Adult MD apply to:** greater than and equal to 18 years of age –or– greater than 40 kg weight (unless stipulated on the algorithm)

**Paediatric MD apply to:** less than 18 years of age –or– less than or equal to 40 kg weight (unless stipulated on the algorithm)

**Ideal Body Weight** (IBW) is calculated from the following formulae:

Adult: 

* Male: IBW in kg =
50 + 2.3 x [ height in inches - 60 ]
* Female: IBW in kg=
45.5 + 2.3 x [ height in inches - 60 ]

Paediatric:  

* IBW in kg for females and males = 2x [age in years] + 10

**Stat patch:** A patch that requires immediate TMP contact in a patient in extremis requiring immediate intervention with clinical interventions not permitted without a patch within the MDSOs. This should be communicated to the Ornge Control Center (OCC) Communication Officer (CO) immediately upon contact with the OCC.

**Ornge Clinical Practice Guidelines:** Selected guidelines have been developed for management of patients in the transport setting, using current best practice and best available evidence. References for these guidelines can be found in the <i>Drug Monographs and References</i> document.

**<u>Certification in this document:</u>**
The Medical Directives, like all other Ornge publications, will be revised and updated on a regular basis.

The Medical Directives will be the most reliable source of information when it comes to patient care. The Drug Monographs may include generic pharmaceutical information.
